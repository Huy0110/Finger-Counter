# Finger-Counter
This is an AI project, written in Python. It can count how many fingers you are raising with real time camera. In addition to counting fingers and showing numbers on the screen, it also presents visual illustrations. Note, the program can only count 1 hand, the right hand will be slightly more accurate than the left hand.
